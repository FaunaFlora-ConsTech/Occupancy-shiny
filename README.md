# Occupancy-shiny

# This repo will demonstrate the shiny dsahboard app for camera trap data.

I am using a subset of data from an African protected area (Serengeti NP, Tanzania). This script is heavily adapted from Kaitlyn Gaynor with small modifications. While the original script has many codes to produce many things, I have only curtailed to produce an occupancy model output (in particular, a predictive map and occupancy-covariate relationship plot). This is still in development phase. ANy comments or pull requests are welcome.
